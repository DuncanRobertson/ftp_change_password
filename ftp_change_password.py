#  passwords weekly (or monthly??) for certain ftp accounts.
#
# 4/01/2013 - now can have a whitespace list of email addresses as well as a single
#             email address after FTPMANAGER and it will email to all addresses mentioned.

An ftp account has been created according to an IT support request, and this is one of the addresses requested to get the credentials.

The server is ftp.companyname.com.au 

We advise using the 'filezilla' free ftp client if you find you are having ftp problems with other ftp clients such as Internet Explorer.
